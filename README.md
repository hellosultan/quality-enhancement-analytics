Quality Enhancement Analytics

Analytics project demonstrating Quality Enhancement in Higher Education using synthetic datasets aligned with QAA UK themes.

📌 About

This project simulates how data can be used to support quality assurance and continuous improvement in higher education. It follows the QAA UK Quality Code areas such as Admissions, Assessment, Monitoring & Evaluation, Student Engagement, and Support Services.

The workflow demonstrates end-to-end data skills:
	1.	Synthetic Data Generation – creating realistic student, assessment, survey, and support datasets.
	2.	Data Cleaning & Preparation – handling missing data, standardising categories, and deriving features.
	3.	KPI Analysis – assessment turnaround, programme pass rates, student engagement, at-risk modules.
	4.	Visualisation & Dashboarding – exporting KPIs to CSV/PNG for dashboards (Power BI/Matplotlib).

📊 Key KPIs
	•	Assessment Turnaround – % returned ≤15 days.
	•	Programme Pass Rates – trends across terms.
	•	Student Engagement Index – surveys × support visits.
	•	At-Risk Modules – low pass rates + low satisfaction.
	•	Scatter Analysis – engagement vs performance.

Outputs are exported to reports/figures/ as CSVs and PNGs for dashboards.
